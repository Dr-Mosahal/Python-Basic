It evaluates to true only if both conditions or expressions on either side of the operator are true. For example, in the expression A && B, both A and B must be true for the overall expression to be true.\n\nLogical OR (||): The logical OR operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true; otherwise, it returns false. It evaluates to true if either of the conditions or expressions on either side of the operator is true. For example, in the expression A || B, if either A or B is true, the overall expression will be true.\n\nLogical NOT (!): The logical NOT operator reverses the logical state of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true. It is a unary operator, meaning it operates on a single operand. For example, !A will be true if A is false, and false if A is true.\n\nThese Boolean operators are used to combine Boolean values or expressions and perform logical operations in programming. They are crucial for creating conditional statements, making logical decisions, and controlling the flow of a program based on truth values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
